# Image-Caption-Generator
Image Caption Generator using Python | Flickr Dataset | Deep Learning(CNN & RNN)
The dataset we used is Flickr dataset, we  can download the dataset from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shadabhussain/flickr8k
Give the file-path where you saved the dataset(data) and also choose file path where file should be saved(working)
The model will be saved(best_model.h5), for further use we can load this model by  code : "model = tf.keras.models.load_model('filepath/model.h5')" .
